# Comprehensive Nomad Cluster Status Report
Generated: $(date)

## Executive Summary

### ✅ Operational Status
- **Nomad Servers**: 2 active (healthy quorum) ✅
- **Nomad Clients**: 2 ready, 2 down ⚠️
- **Consul Servers**: 1 active ⚠️ **CRITICAL SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE**
- **Consul Services**: 31 registered ✅
- **Running Services**: Most critical services operational ✅

### 🎯 Requirements Status

#### 1. 1:1 Parity with Docker Compose
- ⚠️ **PARTIAL**: Most services match, but some discrepancies found:
  - firecrawl-group: Resources fixed (was reduced, now matches)
  - nuq-postgres: Uses local image instead of build (Nomad limitation)
  - Some environment variables may need verification

#### 2. Fully Healthy
- ✅ **MOSTLY**: Most services running
- ⚠️ **ISSUES**:
  - dozzle-group: Failing (55 failed attempts)
  - firecrawl-group: Queued (waiting for dependencies)
  - playwright-service-group: Starting
  - nuq-postgres-group: Starting

#### 3. Complete Fallback/Failover
- ⚠️ **PARTIAL**: 
  - 7 services have HA (count > 1) ✅
  - Many services have count=1 (single points of failure) ⚠️
  - Spread constraints configured for HA services ✅

#### 4. Zero Single Points of Failure
- ❌ **NOT ACHIEVED**: Multiple single points of failure identified:
  - Consul: Only 1 server (CRITICAL)
  - Many services: count=1
  - 2 nodes down (reduces failover capacity)

#### 5. All Nodes Functional
- ⚠️ **PARTIAL**: 
  - 2 nodes ready (micklethefickle, cloudserver1) ✅
  - 2 nodes down (beatapostapita, cloudserver2) ❌

  - Waiting for dependencies (playwright-service, nuq-postgres)
  - Constrained to micklethefickle node
  
- **playwright-service-group**: 1 starting, 0 running
  - Constrained to micklethefickle node
  - Should start soon
  
- **nuq-postgres-group**: 1 starting, 0 running
  - Constrained to micklethefickle node
  - Should start soon

### Services with HA (count > 1)
1. ✅ searxng-group: count=2, spread configured
2. ✅ homepage-group: count=2, spread configured
3. ✅ bolabaden-nextjs-group: count=2, spread configured
4. ✅ aiostreams-group: count=2, spread configured
5. ✅ stremio-group: count=2, spread configured
6. ✅ traefik-group: count=3, spread configured
7. ✅ litellm-group: count=2, spread configured

### Services WITHOUT HA (Single Points of Failure)
- mongodb-group (OK - MongoDB handles replication)
- redis-group ⚠️
- nuq-postgres-group ⚠️
- litellm-postgres-group ⚠️
- playwright-service-group ⚠️
- firecrawl-group ⚠️
- dozzle-group ⚠️
- And 20+ other services

## Critical Issues

### 1. Consul Single Point of Failure - CRITICAL
- **Current**: 1 server (micklethefickle)
- **Required**: 3+ servers for HA
- **Impact**: If Consul fails, all service discovery fails
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Action**: Deploy 2+ additional Consul servers

### 2. Node Availability
- **Down Nodes**: beatapostapita, cloudserver2
- **Reason**: Node heartbeat missed
- **Impact**: Reduced capacity, limited failover
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Action**: Investigate and restore or remove from cluster

### 3. Dozzle Service Failing
- **Status**: 55 failed attempts, latest allocation failed
- **Impact**: Log viewer unavailable
- **Priority**: LOW (non-critical service)
- **Action**: Investigate failure cause

### 4. Firecrawl Dependencies
- **Status**: firecrawl queued, waiting for playwright-service and nuq-postgres
- **Impact**: Firecrawl service unavailable
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Action**: Monitor - services are starting

## 1:1 Parity Issues Found

### Fixed
- ✅ firecrawl-group resources: Updated to match docker-compose (4000 CPU, 4096 memory)

### Remaining
- ⚠️ nuq-postgres: Uses `my-media-stack-nuq-postgres:local` instead of build
  - **Reason**: Nomad doesn't support docker-compose build syntax
  - **Solution**: Pre-build image or use registry image
  - **Status**: Acceptable workaround if image exists

### Needs Verification
- Environment variables: Compare all env vars with docker-compose
- Volume mounts: Verify all volumes match
- Health checks: Verify all health checks match
- Network configuration: Verify network settings

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Priority: HIGH)
1. **Deploy Additional Consul Servers**
   ```bash
   # Deploy Consul on cloudserver1 and another node
   # Ensure 3+ servers for HA
   ```

2. **Monitor Firecrawl Dependencies**
   - Wait for playwright-service and nuq-postgres to start
   - Verify firecrawl starts once dependencies are ready

3. **Investigate Dozzle Failures**
   - Check allocation logs for root cause
   - Verify dockerproxy-ro service is accessible
   - Check resource constraints

### Short-term (Priority: MEDIUM)
1. **Restore Down Nodes**
   - Investigate why beatapostapita and cloudserver2 are down
   - Check network connectivity
   - Restore or remove from cluster

2. **Increase HA for Critical Services**
   - Evaluate Redis Sentinel/Cluster for redis-group
   - Consider read replicas for postgres services where possible
   - Add HA for stateless services

3. **Complete 1:1 Parity Verification**
   - Systematic comparison of all services
   - Document any necessary differences
   - Update Nomad HCL to match docker-compose exactly

### Long-term (Priority: LOW)
1. **Build Process for nuq-postgres**
   - Set up CI/CD to build and push image
   - Or use official image if available
   - Update Nomad HCL to use registry image

2. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Test all service endpoints
   - Verify failover scenarios
   - Load testing for HA services

## Status Summary

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| 1:1 Parity | ⚠️ Partial | Most match, some differences |
| Fully Healthy | ⚠️ Mostly | Most running, some issues |
| Complete Failover | ⚠️ Partial | 7 services HA, many single points |
| Zero SPOF | ❌ No | Consul SPOF, many services count=1 |
| All Nodes Operational | ⚠️ Partial | 2 ready, 2 down |

## Overall Status: 🟡 PARTIALLY HEALTHY

**Cluster is functional with most services operational, but critical infrastructure gaps (Consul HA, node recovery) need addressing for production readiness and zero single points of failure.**
