  # Advanced Relabeling Best Practices Documentation
  # This section documents relabeling patterns for common use cases
  #
  # 1. Label Management:
  #    - Use relabel_configs to add, modify, or drop labels
  #    - Use metric_relabel_configs to filter or modify metrics after scraping
  #    - Keep label cardinality low (avoid high cardinality labels like user IDs, IPs)
  #    - Use consistent label naming across services
  #
  # 2. Common Relabeling Patterns:
  #    - Add environment label:
  #      - source_labels: []
  #        target_label: environment
  #        replacement: ${ENVIRONMENT:-production}
  #
  #    - Extract service name from job:
  #      - source_labels: [job]
  #        regex: '(.+)-exporter'
  #        target_label: service
  #        replacement: '${1}'
  #
  #    - Drop high cardinality labels:
  #      - source_labels: [__name__]
  #        regex: '.*_total'
  #        action: keep
  #      - source_labels: [user_id]
  #        regex: '.+'
  #        action: drop
  #
  #    - Rename labels for consistency:
  #      - source_labels: [instance]
  #        target_label: hostname
  #      - source_labels: [job]
  #        target_label: service
  #
  # 3. Service Discovery Relabeling:
  #    - Use __meta_* labels from service discovery
  #    - Filter targets based on metadata
  #    - Extract useful information from service discovery labels
  #
  # 4. Metric Relabeling:
  #    - Filter unwanted metrics to reduce cardinality
  #    - Rename metrics for consistency
  #    - Drop high cardinality metrics
  #    - Add labels to metrics for better organization
  #
  # Example: Drop high cardinality metrics
  # metric_relabel_configs:
  #   - source_labels: [__name__]
  #     regex: 'http_request_duration_seconds_bucket'
  #     action: keep
  #   - source_labels: [user_id]
  #     regex: '.+'
  #     action: drop
  #
  # Example: Add common labels
  # relabel_configs:
  #   - source_labels: []
  #     target_label: cluster
  #     replacement: ${CLUSTER_NAME:-homelab}
  #   - source_labels: []
  #     target_label: environment
  #     replacement: ${ENVIRONMENT:-production}

  # Runbook Automation Documentation
  # Runbooks provide step-by-step procedures for responding to alerts and incidents
  # This section documents best practices for creating and automating runbooks
  #
  # 1. Runbook Structure:
  #    - Title: Clear, descriptive name
  #    - Description: What the alert indicates
  #    - Severity: Critical, warning, info
  #    - Prerequisites: Required access, tools, knowledge
  #    - Steps: Numbered, actionable steps
  #    - Verification: How to confirm the issue is resolved
  #    - Escalation: When and how to escalate
  #
  # 2. Runbook Best Practices:
  #    - Keep runbooks concise and actionable
  #    - Include relevant metrics and queries
  #    - Provide context about why the alert matters
  #    - Include links to dashboards and documentation
  #    - Update runbooks based on incident learnings
  #    - Review runbooks regularly for accuracy
  #
  # 3. Runbook Automation:
  #    - Use Alertmanager webhooks to trigger automated responses
  #    - Integrate with automation tools (Ansible, Terraform, etc.)
  #    - Create runbook automation scripts for common tasks
  #    - Use runbook_url annotations in alerts for quick access
  #
  # 4. Runbook Examples:

  # Performance Tuning Documentation
  # This section documents performance optimization strategies for large-scale deployments
  # 
  # 1. Prometheus Performance Tuning:
  #    - Query Performance:
  #      * Use recording rules to pre-compute expensive queries
  #      * Limit query time ranges to reduce data processing
  #      * Use appropriate scrape intervals (15s default, adjust based on needs)
  #      * Configure query.max-concurrency and query.max-samples
  #    - Storage Performance:
  #      * Adjust TSDB retention based on available disk space
  #      * Use remote write for long-term storage (VictoriaMetrics)
  #      * Configure storage.tsdb.max-block-duration for optimal compaction
  #      * Monitor TSDB head series and cardinality
  #    - Scraping Performance:
  #      * Use service discovery to reduce manual configuration
  #      * Configure scrape_timeout appropriately (default 10s)
  #      * Use honor_labels and honor_timestamps wisely
  #      * Monitor scrape_duration_seconds for slow targets
  #
  # 2. VictoriaMetrics Performance Tuning:
  #    - Memory Configuration:
  #      * Set memory.allowedPercent based on available RAM (default 60%)
  #      * Monitor memory usage and adjust if needed
  #      * Use --search.maxMemoryPerQuery to limit query memory
  #    - Query Performance:
  #      * Configure --search.maxConcurrentRequests (default 8)
  #      * Set --search.maxQueryDuration for query timeouts
  #      * Use --search.maxPointsPerTimeseries to limit data points
  #      * Configure --search.maxSeries for query limits
  #    - Ingestion Performance:
  #      * Set --insert.maxConcurrentRequests (default 32)
  #      * Monitor ingestion rate and adjust concurrency
  #      * Use --dedup.minScrapeInterval to reduce duplicate data
  #
  # 3. Grafana Performance Tuning:
  #    - Query Performance:
  #      * Enable query caching (Redis/Memcached)
  #      * Use incremental querying for long time ranges
      #      * Configure concurrent_query_limit appropriately
  #      * Optimize dashboard queries (use recording rules)
  #    - Dashboard Performance:
  #      * Limit number of panels per dashboard
  #      * Use appropriate refresh intervals
  #      * Configure maxDataPoints to limit query results
  #      * Use template variables to reduce query complexity
  #    - Caching:
  #      * Enable query result caching
  #      * Configure cache TTL based on data freshness needs
  #      * Use Redis or Memcached for distributed caching
  #
  # 4. Loki Performance Tuning:
  #    - Ingestion Performance:
  #      * Configure ingestion_rate_mb and ingestion_burst_size_mb
  #      * Use appropriate chunk_idle_period and chunk_target_size
  #      * Monitor distributor performance
  #    - Query Performance:
  #      * Configure max_query_parallelism
  #      * Set appropriate query_timeout
  #      * Use query splitting for large time ranges
  #      * Optimize LogQL queries (use filters early)
  #    - Storage Performance:
  #      * Configure retention_period appropriately
  #      * Use compaction to reduce storage overhead
  #      * Monitor storage usage and adjust limits
  #
  # 5. Cardinality Management:
  #    - Monitor high cardinality metrics:
  #      * Use prometheus_tsdb_head_series to track series count
  #      * Alert on high cardinality (e.g., > 1M series)
  #      * Identify high cardinality sources using cardinality_exporter
  #    - Reduce Cardinality:
  #      * Avoid high cardinality labels (user IDs, IPs, etc.)
      #      * Use recording rules to aggregate high cardinality metrics
  #      * Drop unnecessary labels in relabel_configs
  #      * Use metric_relabel_configs to filter metrics
  #
  # 6. Recording Rules Best Practices:
  #    - Pre-compute expensive queries (quantiles, aggregations)
  #    - Aggregate high cardinality metrics
  #    - Use appropriate evaluation intervals (30s default)
  #    - Organize rules by domain (infrastructure, application, etc.)
  #    - Monitor recording rule evaluation time
  #
  # 7. Alerting Performance:
  #    - Use appropriate evaluation intervals
  #    - Configure group_wait and group_interval appropriately
  #    - Limit number of alerts per group
  #    - Use inhibition rules to reduce alert noise
  #    - Monitor alertmanager performance
  #
  # Example Prometheus performance tuning (add to command):
  # - '--storage.tsdb.max-block-duration=2h'
  # - '--storage.tsdb.min-block-duration=2h'
  # - '--query.max-concurrency=20'
  # - '--query.max-samples=50000000'
  # - '--query.timeout=2m'
  #

  # Security Hardening Documentation
  # This section documents security best practices for the monitoring stack
  # For production deployments, implement the following security measures:
  #
  # 1. TLS/HTTPS Configuration:
  #    - Enable TLS for all external-facing services (Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager)
  #    - Use valid SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt, internal CA, or commercial)
  #    - Configure TLS minimum version (TLS 1.2 or higher)
  #    - Disable insecure TLS ciphers
  #
  # 2. Authentication and Authorization:
  #    - Enable authentication for Grafana (OAuth, LDAP, or basic auth)
  #    - Configure RBAC in Grafana for fine-grained access control
  #    - Use API keys with limited permissions for service accounts
  #    - Enable authentication for Prometheus (via reverse proxy or built-in auth)
  #    - Configure Alertmanager authentication
  #
  # 3. Network Security:
  #    - Use internal networks for service-to-service communication
  #    - Expose services only through reverse proxy (Traefik) with authentication
  #    - Implement network policies to restrict access
  #    - Use firewall rules to limit access to monitoring endpoints
  #
  # 4. Secrets Management:
  #    - Store sensitive credentials in environment variables or secret management systems
  #    - Use Docker secrets or Kubernetes secrets for sensitive data
  #    - Rotate credentials regularly
  #    - Never commit secrets to version control
  #
  # 5. Access Control:
  #    - Limit admin access to monitoring systems
  #    - Use read-only access for dashboards where possible
  #    - Implement audit logging for administrative actions
  #    - Regularly review and revoke unused API keys
  #
  # 6. Data Protection:
  #    - Encrypt data at rest for time series databases
  #    - Use encrypted connections for remote write endpoints
  #    - Implement data retention policies
  #    - Regularly backup monitoring data
  #
  # 7. Monitoring Security:
  #    - Monitor authentication failures
  #    - Alert on suspicious access patterns
  #    - Review access logs regularly
  #    - Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
  #
  # Example TLS configuration for Prometheus (add to command):
  # - '--web.config.file=/etc/prometheus/web-config.yml'
  #
  # Example web-config.yml for Prometheus:
  # tls_server_config:
  #   cert_file: /etc/prometheus/certs/prometheus.crt
  #   key_file: /etc/prometheus/certs/prometheus.key
  #   min_version: "TLS12"
  # basic_auth_users:
  #   admin: $2y$10$... # bcrypt hash of password
  #
  # Example Grafana security settings (add to grafana.ini):
  # [security]
  # admin_user = ${GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER:-admin}
  # admin_password = ${GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD:-}
  # secret_key = ${GF_SECURITY_SECRET_KEY:-} # Required for session encryption
  # disable_gravatar = ${GF_SECURITY_DISABLE_GRAVATAR:-true}
  # cookie_secure = ${GF_SECURITY_COOKIE_SECURE:-true}
  # cookie_samesite = ${GF_SECURITY_COOKIE_SAMESITE:-strict}
  # strict_transport_security = ${GF_SECURITY_STRICT_TRANSPORT_SECURITY:-true}
  # strict_transport_security_max_age_seconds = ${GF_SECURITY_HSTS_MAX_AGE:-31536000}
  # x_content_type_options = ${GF_SECURITY_X_CONTENT_TYPE_OPTIONS:-true}
  # x_xss_protection = ${GF_SECURITY_X_XSS_PROTECTION:-true}
  #
  # Example Alertmanager TLS configuration (add to command):
  # - '--web.config.file=/etc/alertmanager/web-config.yml'
  #

  # VictoriaMetrics Backup Service (Optional - enable for automated backups)
  # This service can be scheduled via cron or run manually to create backups
  # For production deployments, consider using vmbackupmanager for automated smart backups
  # 
  # Usage examples:
  # 1. Full backup: docker exec victoriametrics-backup vmbackup -storageDataPath=/storage -snapshot.createURL=http://victoriametrics:8428/snapshot/create -dst=fs:///backups/full-$(date +%Y%m%d)
  # 2. Incremental backup: docker exec victoriametrics-backup vmbackup -storageDataPath=/storage -snapshot.createURL=http://victoriametrics:8428/snapshot/create -dst=fs:///backups/latest
  # 3. Smart backup (hourly incremental, daily full): Use vmbackupmanager or schedule via cron
  #
  # Supported backup destinations:
  # - Local filesystem: fs:///path/to/backup
  # - AWS S3: s3://bucket/path/to/backup
  # - Google Cloud Storage: gs://bucket/path/to/backup
  # - Azure Blob Storage: azblob://container/path/to/backup
  # - S3-compatible storage (MinIO, Ceph): s3://bucket/path with -customS3Endpoint
  #
  # For cloud storage, configure credentials via environment variables:
  # - AWS: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
  # - GCP: GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS (path to service account JSON)
  # - Azure: AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME, AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY
  #
  # Uncomment and configure the service below to enable automated backups:
  # victoriametrics-backup:
  #   image: docker.io/victoriametrics/vmutils:latest
  #   container_name: victoriametrics-backup

  #     - -c
  #     - |
  #       # Example backup script - customize as needed
  #       # This creates an incremental backup to the 'latest' directory
  #       # For smart backups, use vmbackupmanager or schedule full backups separately
  #       vmbackup \
  #         -storageDataPath=/storage \
