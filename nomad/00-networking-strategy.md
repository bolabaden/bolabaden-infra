# Docker to Nomad Networking Strategy

## Key Challenges

### 1. Docker Network Types
- **Docker Compose**: Uses custom bridge networks with specific subnets
- **Nomad**: Uses CNI plugins with different networking models

### 2. Network Isolation Requirements
- **backend**: Internal services (databases, internal APIs)
- **publicnet**: VPN-enabled services that need external access
- **warp-nat-net**: Special routing for WARP services
- **crowdsec_gf**: Security monitoring network
- **nginx_net**: Load balancer network

### 3. VPN Integration
- Multiple Gluetun instances for different geographic regions
- WARP integration for Cloudflare tunneling
- Complex routing rules for VPN traffic

## Nomad Networking Solutions

### 1. CNI Bridge Plugin
```hcl
network {
  mode = "bridge"
  port "service" {
    static = 8080
    to     = 8080
  }
}
```

### 2. Service Discovery
- Use Nomad's built-in service discovery instead of Docker networks
- Services communicate via service names and ports
- Health checks ensure connectivity

### 3. Network Isolation
- Use Nomad's network policies for isolation
- Implement firewall rules at the host level
- Use different job groups for different security zones

### 4. VPN Services
- Run VPN containers with host networking where needed
- Use Nomad's privileged mode for VPN containers
- Implement network policies for VPN routing

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Services
1. Convert basic services without complex networking
2. Use Nomad's default bridge networking
3. Implement service discovery

### Phase 2: Network Isolation
1. Implement network policies
2. Separate services into security zones
3. Configure firewall rules

### Phase 3: VPN Integration
1. Convert VPN services with host networking
2. Implement routing rules
3. Test VPN connectivity

### Phase 4: Advanced Networking
1. Implement custom CNI plugins if needed
2. Optimize network performance
3. Add monitoring and logging

## Service Grouping Strategy

### Group 1: Core Infrastructure (backend network equivalent)
- Redis
- MongoDB
- PostgreSQL instances
- Internal APIs

### Group 2: Public Services (publicnet equivalent)
- Traefik
- Web services
- Public APIs
- VPN services

### Group 3: Security Services (crowdsec_gf equivalent)
- CrowdSec
- Security monitoring
- Firewall services

### Group 4: VPN Services (warp-nat-net equivalent)
- Gluetun instances
- WARP services
- NAT routing services

## Configuration Approach

### 1. Use Nomad Variables
- Define network configurations in variables
- Use templates for dynamic configuration
- Implement environment-based settings

### 2. Service Dependencies
- Use Nomad's dependency system
- Implement health checks
- Configure restart policies

### 3. Volume Management
- Use Nomad's volume management
- Implement backup strategies
- Configure persistent storage

## Implementation Notes

### 1. Port Mapping
- Map Docker ports to Nomad ports
- Use static ports for external services
- Use dynamic ports for internal services

### 2. Health Checks
- Convert Docker health checks to Nomad checks
- Implement proper timeout and retry logic
- Use appropriate check types (HTTP, TCP, script)

### 3. Resource Limits
- Convert Docker resource limits to Nomad resources
- Implement proper CPU and memory constraints
- Configure storage requirements

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Service Connectivity
- Test inter-service communication
- Verify service discovery
- Check health check functionality

### 2. Network Isolation
- Test network policies
- Verify firewall rules
- Check VPN connectivity

### 3. Performance
- Benchmark network performance
- Test under load
- Optimize configurations
